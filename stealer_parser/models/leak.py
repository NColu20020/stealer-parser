"""Data model to define a leak's content.

- Metadata: contextual information (origin, date, size, ...)
- Compromised systems found in the leak
- Credentials found in the leak, sorted by system.
"""
#Purpose: Structures the parsed data of a leak, organizing metadata, compromised systems, and credentials.
#Classes:
#SystemData: Represents data associated with a single compromised system, with methods like add_stealer_name to label credentials with the infostealer name.
#Leak: Represents the overall structure of a leak, storing the archiveâ€™s filename and a list of SystemData objects for all compromised systems found in the archive.
#This module organizes parsed data, grouping credentials by system and enabling easier aggregation and export.
